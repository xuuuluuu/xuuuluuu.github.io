Greetings! I am currently a Researcher at the [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/). Previously, I had the privilege to participate in the joint PhD programme offered by the [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) and the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). My academic achievements include a Master of Engineering degree from the the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/), and a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the SUTD, where I was awarded the highest honor of SUMMA CUM LAUDE.

I have contributed to several well-known conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and AAAI, through my research which mainly focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) - specifically information extraction and sentiment analysis. However, I also dedicate a considerable amount of my time in other machine learning domains including Computer Vision (CV).

My current work centers on retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs). Should you be interested in pursuing a research internship position in our group, I would be happy to review your CV. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via email.
