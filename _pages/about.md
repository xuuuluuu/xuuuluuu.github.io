Welcome! I am currently under a joint Ph.D programme between [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) and [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). I earned my first Master of Engineering degree from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) and my second Master of Engineering (Research) from the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/), and my Bachelor of Engineering (with SUMMA CUM LAUDE) from the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).

My work has been published in ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and AAAI conferences. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as information extraction and sentiment analysis. While my primary focus is NLP, I also spend my time on general machine learning problems and Computer Vision (CV).
