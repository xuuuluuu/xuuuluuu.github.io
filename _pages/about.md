I’m currently focused on advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) as a researcher with the Seed (LLM) Team at ByteDance in Singapore.

Previously, I was with Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, also in Singapore. My academic background includes a joint PhD between the Alibaba DAMO Academy and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), a Master of Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a Bachelor of Engineering from SUTD, where I graduated with top honors.

My core research area is Natural Language Processing (NLP), with publications in top venues like ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and AAAI. I also explore areas such as Computer Vision and Speech Recognition.

If you're interested in a research internship or full-time role with our team, feel free to reach out!
