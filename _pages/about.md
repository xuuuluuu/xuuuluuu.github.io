Welcome! I am currently a Researcher at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/). Prior to that, I was under the joint PhD programme between [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) and [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). I received my Master of Engineering degree from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/), and my Bachelor of Engineering (with SUMMA CUM LAUDE) from the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).

My work has been published in conferences including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and AAAI. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), including information extraction and sentiment analysis. While my primary focus is on NLP, I also spend some of my time in general machine learning and Computer Vision (CV) fields.

Recently, I am working on retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs).
